Though the unibody aluminum housing design had been there for almost a decade, it‚Äôs still the best looking mini computer case on the market imo. In mid 2019, Raspberry Pi receive a huge update - the Pi 4. We finally got true gigabit ethernet, USB3.0 support, and a lot more. This makes Pi 4 suitable for simple NAS project (also for TimeMachine backup). So I decide to build a fake(?) TimeCapsule with Pi (at least the case is real, or should I just call it ‚ÄúFake Mac mini‚Äù ? lol) This article will show how I build this project, and the issue that I ran into (hardware side, the software configuration can be found at: Use Raspberry Pi to build a FAKE TimeCapsule - Software, Use Raspberry Pi as a NAS)(haven‚Äôt translate to English yet). Idea &amp;&amp; Design(https://static.driftking.tw/2024/06/e39d19076b26e35c8b8e075f87a977ed.jpg) I bought this used Mac mini case for cheap (around 20USD), it still in very good shape. You can buy it from ebay or AliExpress. First, let‚Äôs do some simple measure. The maximum motherboard you can put inside is around 17cm*17inch (lots of people use Mini-ITX in Mac mini‚Äôs case.) Height is about 2.5cm, for our Pi project is more than enough. Here‚Äôs the first design diagram (the hub will cause some issue so I connect the HDDs direct to Pi in final product, see Troubleshooting): All I need to do is mount these things up. So I decide to draw some 3D printed files to do the job. And here‚Äôs the diagram that shows each mounting hole‚Äôs distance I measured. Next, the HDD mount. The arm on both side aren‚Äôt strong enough, so I just cut them off. Here comes the tricky part. Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no information about the mounting screw for Mac mini case. ifixit only says it‚Äôs four 7.9mm long Torx screw, didn‚Äôt mention the shaft diameter. I tried several screw that I have, luckily, one screw can screw in and quite stable. So I can use caliper to measure it‚Äôs size: 1.7mm (You can use M1.7 phillips tapping screw instead of official torx screw) Pi mounting plate. An isolation brick to protect GPIO pins is nice to have: Make some feet under the mounting plate. The I/O shield (the plastic frame for Mini-ITX I/O shield is brought from other maker) Left side is for USB-C female connector and ethernet extender cable, right side for momentary power switch. I made some mistake about the side mounting holes on I/O shield, so just ignore it. (The ethernet extender cable‚Äô screw can hold I/O shield in place) Also need to cut the Pi mounting plate to fit in the case. Finally, the 30mm fan mount: The STL files I used in this project can be download at: PiMacMiniCaseSTLFiles InstallationAlright, here‚Äôs the finished 3D printed items. (SLA Resin) I‚Äôve found that the holes on I/O shield are a bit too small. So need to enlarge the Type-C and switch hole for a better fit. Sand down the surface and paint them in matte black. Ouch! There‚Äôs a crack on the edge when I try to trim it. But since it‚Äôs hide in the case, not a big deal. And I forgot the Micro SD on pi protrudes from the edge, so more trimming work need to be done. Then opens up the USB to SATA cable and cut out the VCC connect on board. Use some electrical tape to cover the board. Remember to check the pins with multimeter, make sure we didn‚Äôt ruined the cable. Screw in HDDs and test the mount. And solder the power line to Type-C connector. One for HDDs, other for Pi. Momentary switch with LED. I use 1k Ohm resistor here. About the wiring diagram you can check my other article: Raspberry Pi - Power switch, External power LED, SD Act LED(Haven‚Äôt translate to English yet) Test it! Glue the power switch and Type-C connector in place. Some simple wiring. Put on the bottom cover. Done! Bay ~ OK I think it just looks like a real Mac mini PS The max cpu temperature is around 50¬∞C (room temp:26~28¬∞C) TroubleshootingMac mini housing screw spec?I use phillips M1.7 x 6mm tapping screw. USB powered hub issueSome usb 3 powered hub will prevent Pi 4 from booting, here‚Äôs some discussion on Pi‚Äôs official forum: Pi 4 fails to boot when active USB switch attached. You can unplug the powered hub and plug it back. Pi will starts to boot and everything worked fine, but it‚Äôs really annoying. Some people reports that cut out the Vcc on hub can solve the issue, but I tried and nothing happened :( So I end up modify the USB to SATA cable instead. HDD and pi both using a 3A Official Power SupplyÔºüI actually connect 2 HDD and Pi to the same power source, which is an official power supply. The main reason I do this is to avoid Pi‚Äôs USB port maximum 1.2A downstream limit. I‚Äôve measure the current drain on both HDD(w/ USB to SATA cable) and Pi, and it‚Äôs enough to be powered by a 3A power supply (my WD HDD‚Äôs peak current when activating is about 750mA) but can‚Äôt be power direct through Pi‚Äôs USB port due to 1.2A current limit. (I tried to connect direct to Pi‚Äôs USB, and one HDD fail to mount) Note that 1 HDD is fine to direct plug it into Pi‚Äôs USB port.

In most case pi didn‚Äôt need that amount of cooling performance, so we can use PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to control fan speed and reduce the noise. WiringI use Noctua NF-A4 5V PWM, a 40mm, 5V PWM fan. Here‚Äôs the wiring diagram: Yellow: 5V Black: GND Green: RPM signal Blue: PWM signal input If your fan doesn‚Äôt support PWM control, then you can see #138 Variable Speed Cooling Fan for Raspberry Pi using PWM and PID controller or PWM Regulated Fan Based on CPU Temperature for Raspberry Pi to use a BJT transistor to use PWM control. The fan‚Äôs RPM signal is an OC(Open-Collector) circuit design (in most fan), so you‚Äôll need a pull-up resistor to measure output waveform according to Noctua PWM white paper. Warning! The Pi has 3.3V GPIO, so your pull-up resistor must be connect to 3.3V ONLY! You will fry your Pi if Vcc is connected to 5V. The pull-up resistor that I use is 1kŒ© 1/4W. The white paper says the maximum current is 5mA. According to Ohm‚Äôs Law: $V=IR$, the resistor should be 660Œ© or larger to protect your fan. Most micro-controller or SBC already have a decent circuit to generate PWM signal, you don‚Äôt need special circuit to generate it. I use a Molex 2510 4PIN (2.54mm) connector to connect the fan.

But recently I don‚Äôt feel very comfortable when using my Master 3 with multiple devices, because the only button that switches device is located under the mouse. Since my 2 devices aren‚Äôt in the same network so Logitech Flow won‚Äôt work either. Not really sure why Logitech doesn‚Äôt allow user to configure gesture button to switch devices :( so I came up with an idea to solve it. ModificationThe idea is actually quite simple. I can connect the device switch button to thumb gesture button, and configure it to do nothing when pressed in Logitech Options. Here‚Äôs how I do it: Remove mouse feet and screws (1 x T5 and 5 #0 Philips Screws) Be careful with the ribbon when open the top case Unscrew all components (battery, scrolling wheel) (Optional) I also change the momentary switch by the way, Kailh silent mouse switches were used this time Wired up the switch device button with thumb gesture button Set gesture button to Do Nothing in Logitech Options Finish!

Though the iPad is already very thin (5.9mm on pro model), the drawing experience is still far from drawing on a flat thin paper, and putting hand on iPad just waste a large portion of the screen, which is the main reason I come up with this project today. The result was quite good, it‚Äôs very easy to make and costs under 35 dollar, so I want to share with you today. DraftingFirst, this project is design to create a flat surface for your hand to rest on when drawing on an iPad. Most drawing tablets on the market always have some sort of bezel for hands to rest on, but it‚Äôs imaginable that Apple will never design like this on a consumption/portable tablet. Since iPad is not only for drawing purpose, so I came up with this idea: I can make myself an iPad drawing board, that is detachable when you don‚Äôt need it (like when you go on a trip and just want to watch Netflix on it), which sounds great right? Of course I‚Äôm not the first one trying to solve this issue, there‚Äôs already similar products on the market: Sketch Board Pro but the $120‚Äôs price tag is just a bit too high, and the size is too large for my table. The other one I found on Taobao is pretty cheap like around 30~40USD, but it‚Äôs very thick, heavy and most importantly, the size is too large for my table too. So I decide to make one fits myself. The goals for this project: The hand can rest on the same level with iPad‚Äôs screen Design for iPad Pro 11 inch and iPad Air 4 Won‚Äôt block any feature on iPad (buttons, speaker, etc.) iPad can attach on it with magnet As portable as possible Can use both in portrait and landscape mode The cheaper the better After serious thought, here‚Äôs my solution: The material I plan to use is linden plywood, 4 layers in total. The reason that I make the USB C slot facing outside is because it can be used with any accessory, like a Type-C hub for example. The magnet part to hold iPad is actually pretty easy to deal with, I just use third-party magnet folio cover and cut it in half, then glued onto the plate and that‚Äôs it. You can use the Apple official folio cover to get the best result but I think that‚Äôs an over kill LOL. BTW for those who interest, the folio cover I use is from UGreen, I‚Äôve seen ESR has the same kind of product too. All of them works I think. Then use Illustrator to draw the outline of the board. 5mm Bottom plate, about $31cm * 24.5cm$ and have a notch for Apple Pencil. 3mm Bottom plate, it will glue to the top of 5mm one, it has a camera hole to fit the camera bump. The hand rest has 2 layers too, one for 3mm the other is 5mm. 8mm total is about as same thickness as the iPad plus the folio cover. And there‚Äôs a cutout at the bottom right for power button or Air 4‚Äôs finger print reader. You can support me and download the *.ai files from here üòâ Material/Tool Laser cutting linden plywood Adhesive for wood (I use 3M Scotch, you can use white glue but needs more time to dry) Folio cover Black tape (fix the cover edge after cutting) File (smooth down the edge of woods) Make it realIt‚Äôs actually almost done after we got the laser cutting plywood. Cut the folio cover and glue them together, done! You can use it with any tablet/laptop stand you want! Landscape mode: Portrait mode: It‚Äôs just what we want right? And iPad is very stable thanks to the magnet cover underneath it, the speaker and buttons works just like normal, and the cutout for the Apple Pencil works as intended, it‚Äôs very easy to take it down and start drawing.
