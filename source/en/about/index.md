Hi, DriftKingTW here. Welcome to my blog.

I'm a junior web developer, and also a digital artist from Taiwan. 

Love to make stuff, especially electronic-related project. Not a native English speaker tho, but I'm trying to translate my post into English. If something looks odd, I apologize for that ｡ﾟ(ﾟ´ω`ﾟ)ﾟ｡

If you're interested in my artwork, make sure to check out my [Pixiv](https://pixiv.me/driftkingtw) or [DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/driftkingtw). And the code I use in my project can be find on [Github](https://github.com/driftkingtw).

BTW if you love EDM, go and check my friend's music channel: [Silaver](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3u5AUgOfRcAT2JtWlq1Y-w). No doubt you'll like it :D
